# Capstone_project
Here’s a clean and professional **README.md** for your rice classifier Streamlit app, ready to include in your GitHub repo:

---

```markdown
# 🍚 Rice Classifier Pro

A web-based rice variety classification app powered by deep learning and built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). Upload an image of rice, and the app will predict its variety using a pre-trained CNN model.

## 🚀 Demo

Try it live on **Streamlit Cloud**:  
[🔗 App Link](https://share.streamlit.io/your-username/rice-classifier/main/rice_app.py) *(replace with your actual URL)*

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Classifies rice images into trained categories
- 🎨 Styled with custom CSS
- 📈 Includes model performance reports and interactive charts
- 🎉 Fun UI with animation using `streamlit-extras`
